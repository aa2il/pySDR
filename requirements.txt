# Code has been migrated to uv - See README.md for instructions.
#
# This was how this used to work:
#     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
#
# There are some changes in the latest pyqtgraph so for now, we use
# the older version until I can catch up
#
#    pip3 install --upgrade pyqtgraph==0.12.4
#
# Once these are resolved, should be able to use 
#
#     pip3 install --upgrade pyqtgraph
#
# but, in true linux fashion, it was broken in Python 3.11 - great jobs guys!

# Under Mint 21, tried this but didn't work --> "Illegal Instruction"

#   sudo apt -y install python3-soapysdr soapysdr-module-rtlsdr
#   sudo apt -y install libsoapysdr-doc libsoapysdr-dev soapysdr-tools
#   sudo apt -y install rtl-sdr librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
#
# Use sudo apt remove ... to get rid of them before attempting to build.
# Had to resort to building from source.  Hopefully this will get
# resolved some day.
#
# Also tried it under RPi Bookworm - these mostly work except need to
# build Soapy driver for the SDRplay.  This is probably bx they use
# a propietary driver.
